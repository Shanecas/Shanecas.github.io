<p>My Name is Princess Shane L. Casimsiman, I am 18 years old and I was born on August 09, 2004 at Lapu-lapu Cebu City. I am the second of the three children, along with my two brothers. I graduated my Senior Highschool at Iligan Computer Institute (ICI) by the strand of Accountancy Business Management (ABM). I am now a college student and currently studying in one of the prestigious University in Cagayan De Oro which is the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines and taking up Bachelor of Science in Technology Communication Management (BS TCM). I chose this specific course because I've always enjoyed learning and enhancing my communication skills, so I knew I wanted to pursue a career in this type of field especially to become a Flight attendant or Stewardess someday. I wanted nothing more than to become one.</p>

<p>I really adore dancing, it helps me cope with stress. I am a tambourine dancer in our church ministry. My kind of music are Taylor Swifts and I enjoy playing guitar. I enjoy playing mobile games as well, it is also my escape from having a bad day. And I love street foods. My favourite colors are neutral colors. And I like flowers especially tulips.</p>
